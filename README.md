# PostGreSQL_Database_Queries
You are working for a business that owns two DVD rental stores. Both stores use software to
manage the DVD rentals, but the software has no reporting capabilities.
The owner wants to better understand various aspects of his business, and has asked you a
few questions.
In order to answer his questions, you will design and execute a few queries on the database
of the DVD rental software that is used by the stores (there is one database for both stores).
You can view the database schema at the following link:
http://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-sample-database/
This page also contains instructions to download the full database and restore it in a
PostgreSQL instance that you will set up.
